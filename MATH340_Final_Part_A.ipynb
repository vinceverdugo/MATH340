    "The information given by Robert May in *Simple Mathematical Models With Very Complicated Dynamics* and *The Problem of Deducing the Climate from the Governing Equations* by Edward Lorenz, as well as the Logistic Map Wikipedia are extremely helpful in understanding the characteristics of the Logistic Equation. In addition to reviewing these literature, over the course of the semester these same characteristics were explored in homework assignments in the Math340 course. Topics covered included The Simplest ODE, Using Finite Difference Methods to solve ODEs, The simplest ODE and its connection to the Fibonacci Sequence, Solutions of the Logistic Equation using symbolic compuring, Numerical solutions of the Logistic Map, he Sigmoid function and The Softmax function. In covering these topics, I have gained valuable exerience in modeling, compuation, and visualization that I hope will allow me to pursue a career in Data Analytics. "
